AutoCoA (Automatic generation of Chain-of-Action) is an agent model framework that enhances the multi-turn tool usage capability of reasoning models. The framework internalizes the Chain-of-Action (CoA) generation, allowing agent models to autonomously decide when and how to use external tools to improve task completion in open-domain QA tasks, particularly those requiring long-term reasoning and multi-step actions.


## Features
- **End-to-end Tuning:** Combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable seamless transition between reasoning and action.
- **Step-level Action Triggering:** Teaches the model when to take action using contrastive learning at critical reasoning junctures.
- **Trajectory-level CoA Optimization:** Enhances the model's behavior through full CoT (Chain-of-Thought) and CoA sequences.
- **Internal World Model:** Reduces interaction costs with real environments by simulating tool interactions during training.
